/**
 * This class is the starting point for the account management database
 * utility. This tool provides a way to retrieve and store data in the
 * database which sits behind the Account Management App without the
 * need of a UI. There are four modes in which this tool can be run:
 *
 * GET - This mode pulls down the information stored in the database. A new
 *       file is created in the work directory for each domain (table) in the
 *       database, and all items (rows) are stored in XML markup.
 *
 * PUT - This mode pushes the information contained in the files in the work
 *       directory into the database, overwriting any entries which already
 *       exist. The best way to use this feature is to perform a GET first,
 *       then edit the files which were produced to add/update any entries.
 *
 * CLEAR - This mode clears out all of the items (rows) in all of the database
 *         domains (tables). As a safety precaution, a GET is performed prior
 *         to the CLEAR, so that you have a backup of the data which was in
 *         the database prior to the clear.
 *
 * Usage Notes:
 *
 * - If you want to remove items (rows) from the database, you can perform a
 *   CLEAR, then edit the files which were created in the GET, followed by a
 *   PUT. This will ensure that only the items (rows) included in the files
 *   are in the database.
 *
 * - A PUT will only perform updates based on what is included in the files in
 *   the work directory. If you only want to work with a single domain (table),
 *   you can perform a GET, then delete all of the files produced other than
 *   the one you'd like to edit.
 *
 * - Performing a GET will overwrite any files produced on a previous run if
 *   it is pointed to the same work directory. This is also the case for the
 *   GET which is performed automatically prior to a CLEAR. Be careful not to
 *   overwrite your edited files when performing either of these functions.
 * 
 * - When performing a PUT command, the items (rows) to be added are compared
 *   to the existing database. If an item (row) already exists and all of the
 *   values are equal, no update occurs (and the database counter is not
 *   updated, as this only occurs when an item is changed.)
